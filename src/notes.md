## About me
I'm mainly a Front End developer with industry experience building websites and apps. I specilize in Javascript. My job is to build modern web applications with quality and efficiency. I have worked with Angular, React, Node, Vue, etc.

Most of my experience has been as a front end developer but I have done a bit of everything. Backend and devops are part of my life now. Thanks to that, I'm able to build apps from scratch into production.


Extra info
Born and raise in Venezuela. I left after finishing uni with a bachelor degree in chemistry. Weird right. [Not soo weird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_chemistry). Love to travel and meet people. In the last 6 years I have move a lot. I'd lived in 6 different countries and still counting. My love number 1 is tech The right app at the right moment can change the world.
